## Opening new issues

- Before opening a new issue check if there are any existing FAQ entries (if one exists), issues or pull requests that match your case
- Open an issue, and make sure to label the issue accordingly - bug, improvement, feature request, etc...
- Be as specific and detailed as possible

## Did you find a bug?

- Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security
vulnerability, instead email the maintainers directly or email
oss-community-management@datarobot.com if they do not respond within
seven days
- Ensure the bug was not already reported in the projects Issues section
- Open an issue as described above

## Changelog

All pull requests should include an entry in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file unless the changes are trivial (e.g., fixing typos, minor documentation updates).

If your PR doesn't require a changelog entry (e.g., documentation-only changes, CI configuration), add the `skip-changelog` label to your pull request.

## Responding to issues and pull requests

This project's maintainers will make every effort to respond to any
open issues as soon as possible.

If you don't get a response within seven days of creating your issue or
pull request, please send us an email at oss-community-management@datarobot.com
